# Data Cleaning & Transformation

Used a Dataset(Netflix Movies and TV Shows) from Kaggle to do cleaning and transformation.

---

## Overview
Selelcted a data set from kaggle to clean and transform it  using 3 functions of python.

---

## Features
1. Download kaggle data set from website using python.
2. Inspect the dataset by using basic info (meta data)
3. Cleaned and transformed by converting csv into pandad dataframe
4. Finally validate the transformed clean data
